Bitflu internals:


Bitflus "core" plugins
-----------------------------------

bitflu.pl provides some builtin core services.


  package Bitflu
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The Bitflu package is used to startup all core and
  external plugins. It also provides some builtin mechanism
  for logging and chrooting/dropping privs

  package Bitflu::Tools
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Provides some handy subs such as sha1-hashing, URI-Escaping, DNS-Lookups
  and other things.

  package Bitflu::Configuration
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  All plugins must use this module to manipulate the bitflu configuration file.
  Plugins can store, read and lock values using this package.

  package Bitflu::Admin
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Admin is used by UI-Frontends (such as telnet) to dispatch commands.
  User authentication (useradmin command) is also handled by this package.
  
  package Bitflu::QueueMgr
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Used to manage bitflus download queue (= Open Storage-Items) 

  package Bitflu::Network

  All in- and outgoing network traffic is done by Bitflu::Network.
  The plugin can create new TCP and UDP sockets and will "notify" the
  creator if new data has been received (= calls a pre-defined subroutine)
