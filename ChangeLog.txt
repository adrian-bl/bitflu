*FIXME*: Dass {seed} in chokemap muss getestet und dynamisch berechnet werden (1/4 von chokeslots oder so?)
Version 0.43

     BitTorrent:
      * Support for MAGNET links
      * Added 'pause' and 'resume' commands.
      * Only keep needed information form the torrent in memory
      * Removed partial FastPeers support: Mainline dropped support in
        version 6.x (also known as uTorrent)
      * Delay ReleasePiece calls after receiving a CHOKE message.
        This helps to work around some obscure uTorrent UNCHOKE->CHOKE->UNCHOKE
        tactic.
      * Bugfix: import_torrent can now correctly slurp torrents
                that include zero-sized files.
        
     WebUI:
      * Added a (bare-bones) WebUI: http://127.0.0.1:4081/

     StorageFarabDb:
      * Added 'files .. include' and 'files .. exclude' (for selective downloads!)
      * Fixed 'files .. list' percent calculation to be more accurate :-)
      * Replaced the 'pcommit' command with 'files queue_id commit 1 2 3'
      * Display percentage while verifing storage
      * Do not cache more than 256 bytes per setting (Caching _torrent
        doesn't make much sense)
      * Cache Free/Inwork/Done data using a bitfield
      * (Try to) fsync() file before moving it to .done

     Core:
      * API-Change: Changed how ->ExecuteCommand works:
                    Plugins can now return 'leftovers' (SCRAP) that we'll
                    pass to the remaining plugins.
                    This makes it possible pass torrent and http-urls to
                    a single 'load' command.
      * Added 'pluginexclude' setting:
         pluginexclude = 10_AdminTelnet.pm;99_Cron.pm
        would disable the telnet + cron plugin

Version 0.42 (Released: 20071226)

     Core:
      * Enhancement: Run out-of-the-box on Perl 5.10 by using Digest::SHA if
                     installed (and fallback to Digest::SHA1 if it isn't)
      * Bugfix: Check for EWOULDBLOCK and EAGAIN if syswrite() failed.
                This fix makes bitflu a much better uploader :-)
      * Bugfix: Reject incoming connection if $sock->peername; fails
      * API-Change: Callbacks are now registered while creating the socket.
      * API-Change: Throttle is depricated. Use WriteDataNow() instead.
      * Many netiolib changes (This release includes version 20071220_1)
      * Use /dev/null instead of /dev/zero to test file descriptors.
      * Try to read() multiple times from a socket while in _IOread();

     BitTorrent:
      * Bugfix: Release locked pieces on unchoke.
      * Bugfix: Do not crash if torrent has an empty info=>{} hash
      * Removed torrent_huntpriority and torrent_slowspread settings.
      * Added torrent_upslots setting. (Configures how many peers can be unchoked)
      * Run an unchoke round each 30sec+skew (not each 20sec like 0.41 did), optimistinc
        unchoking has also been implemented (we are unchoking 1 GLOBAL peer)
      * Rewrote mainloop: The 'GarbageCollector' runs now each second but does only
        work on a small subset of peers.
      * Try (even more) to avoid calls to $self->Hunt; (they can be very expensive)
      * Do not accept more than 30 peers per ut_pex message.
      * DebugPeer (the 'x' command) does now display the name (+ version) of some
        well known clients such as uTorrent, Azureus, BitComet.. etc..
      * Trackerblacklist matches are now caseINsensitive

     AdminTelnet:
      * Removed the flags column and replaced it by colors + text
      * Added command 'details'

     Kademlia:
      * Do not accept malformed kademlia nodes ($port == 1) in response
        to get_peers/find_nodes as this will just trigger a bugcheck/panic.

     StorageFarabDb:
      * Check storage directory on first ->OpenStorage call
      * Security fix: A malicious .torrent could have caused bitflu to
                      either append data to existing files or create
                      new files (overwriting files was not possible) 'outside'
                      it's own workdir while committing the download.
                      The storage driver will now try to sanitize filenames
                      and refuses to append data to existing files.
                      Well.. fixing this was on my todo list for 0.40 but i forgot
                      to implement it...
                      Remember: Always run bitflu inside a chroot jail ;-)

        


Version 0.41 (Released: 20071213)

     Core:
      * Added 'pcommit' command
      * Mark broken commits wit a 'INCOMPLETE_' prefix
      * Advertise MAX_OUTSTANDING_REQUESTS via EPROTO-Handshake
      * Added 'useradmin' command (Authentication)
      * Fixed some perl warnings and adjusted loglevel
      * Bugfix: StorageFarabDb: OpenStorage does now cache (and more important) share
                the storage object globally. This fixes a rare 'race condition'.

     BitTorrent:
      * Added Kademlia Support
      * Downloading a .torrent file using the 'load' command will now
        trigger an auto-import (= Bitflu will start load the torrent itself)
      * Implemented PPL-Hunting: Bitflu will now try to get some complete pieces ASAP


Version 0.40
      * This is a complete rewrite
