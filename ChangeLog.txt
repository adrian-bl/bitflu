Version 0.42

     Core:
      * Bugfix: Check for EWOULDBLOCK and EAGAIN if syswrite() failed.
                This fix makes bitflu a much better uploader :-)
      * Use /dev/null instead of /dev/zero to test file descriptors.

     BitTorrent:
      * Rewrote mainloop: The 'GarbageCollector' runs now each second but does only
        work on a small subset of peers.
      * Try (even more) to avoid calls to $self->Hunt;

Version 0.41 (Released: 20071213)

     Core:
      * Added 'pcommit' command
      * Mark broken commits wit a 'INCOMPLETE_' prefix
      * Advertise MAX_OUTSTANDING_REQUESTS via EPROTO-Handshake
      * Added 'useradmin' command (Authentication)
      * Fixed some perl warnings and adjusted loglevel
      * Bugfix: StorageFarabDb: OpenStorage does now cache (and more important) share
                the storage object globally. This fixes a rare 'race condition'.

     BitTorrent:
      * Added Kademlia Support
      * Downloading a .torrent file using the 'load' command will now
        trigger an auto-import (= Bitflu will start load the torrent itself)
      * Implemented PPL-Hunting: Bitflu will now try to get some complete pieces ASAP


Version 0.40
      * This is a complete rewrite
